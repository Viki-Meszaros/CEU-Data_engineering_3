Can they be stupid enough to think money is more important than anything? That really annoyed me in the movie, I almost mundled my glasses. But human values are much more important. If you have that, you'll have the money later on you. Because then the peak of human existence can be created: happiness plus wealth together. Thank God I got that because my wife hasn't listened to her silly mother in 30 years. It's like I've seen my own story, but the end of it is nonsense. In bed, in pillows together.

"4","It may be a bit cheese — more like a framework story for the elderly — but I've seen much better.
The two main characters are taking the movie. World literature is full of such “gicsses” stories. Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde, Orpheus and Euridice and more. These are still working today. In today's accelerated world there is also a need for tales, and it is possible that there are fortunate people to whom the fairy tale happens.","en",0.988941133022308,"MIXED",0.78737,0.0069,0.00574,0.19999
"5","You misunderstand. It is not the love that lasts to the grave that is sentimental, but the way it is presented in this movie in a cheap, pretentious way. Instead of authentic emotions, empty sentimentality.

Yeah, it's unthinkable nowadays.

"16","SPOILER 
It's an overrated movie. 
mr. Heartbreaker's fashionable, early play is absolutely unconvincing, Rachel and her have no chemistry, which may not be visible because it's still Ms. Hudson. McAdams' career break, this film was the big leap. 
Ms. Bell. McAdams, as they say, gave him his best. Rachel's body, however, because of the Irish and Scottish ascents, has moles in too white and unwanted places, so it is presumed that mr. Heartbreaker takes off stockings from a foot double in one of the “hot” scenes of the film (watch the changing hairdress and how Ryan's wet body dries in one blow during the scene). By the way, staring at Ms. McAdams' rattling ribs is no pleasure. The top is, “I'm gonna take your pants down so you can pick me up upstairs “- that's more ridiculous than romantic. Closing the love scene, Allie is watching her love sleep, although at that time there was no corrective mutt for the septum of the nose, so it's hard to believe that the film “Noah” would not snore into the image of her love. 
Martha and Allie's friendship is surreal, and Allie's remaining volcanic logic unravels her love disappointment. Everyone can express moral heights in words that completely distract the viewer. The screenwriter does not let the viewer feel what the character is thinking: instead he puts the emotional projection into his mouth, rubs it with geometric accuracy and rubs it all in the viewer's nose (see Martha evaluates her potential while Goslin stares with veal eyes and McAdams is jealous at a glance you will get sorting instructions). The arrows are painted on the floor the next morning, which is just plain sorting nonsense.
The characters are not deep enough, their vocations are theatrical, largely lacking in vitality. The one-minute stereotype put into the mother's story is a plastic side rather than an artist. 
The fundamental tension of “film in film” works would be parallel conflict, but instead of creating tension, the film quietly shoots jokes without catharsis. The viewer looks bored at the end of the film, disappointed with the end, and pretty much feels: “Now, we've seen this too”.
If you are looking for a lifely-smelling female character coming back and forth between the real male characters and want to know “how it went before, when there was no Tinder, facebook, viber, etc.”, you should take a look at the worlds of Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn, where the female character Julia Ormond se is a wretched traveler, in his life: https://port.hu/adatlap/film/tv/szenvedelyek-viharaban-legends-of-the-fall/movie-2301
In the 21st century, such “love nearsightedness” no longer exists, but the forties who scored the film raise their young years - with the tenth votes - to pedestal. I assure them: girls attracted to their Gosling partner don't expect years for a potential orgasm these days, but they just check it out, maybe too fast, without wanting to get married.
Nowadays you don't need a newspaper article to get news of your love back from the front for years. The modern soldier discusses with the family before and after the deployment, if at all he has to leave the country for service, not to control the Middle East drones from the Nevada desert, not to mention the couples of soldiers serving together.
The landscape is beautiful, but the rain from the sprinklers can make the experience forget. By the way, the domestic ducks don't fly anywhere, so I guess the wild ducks didn't want to be on the set, and no trained swans were handy.
Above forty recommended pieces, 6/10 for them, forgettable for younger ones.","en",0.993459761142731,"NEGATIVE",0.00107,0.64842,0.14998,0.20053
"17","I've seen it once, but not from the beginning. It didn't affect me that much. I've just looked at it, and the beginning of the story really struck me, but at the same time the end SPOILER was terribly corny, lifeless, and so it hit me to death. The teenage love thread is quite credible, and those who lack depth, character regression and character development have probably forgotten that teenage lovers tend not to develop along human/moral values, but rather physical attraction and chemistry predominate. At the same time, character development in life is not always guaranteed. I mean, so far, the story is authentic. The end, on the other hand, is a concentrated spill, and so the effect that we managed to create in the beginning completely dissolved by the end. It's a shame, because it could have been done without disappointing me.","en",0.993633210659027,"NEGATIVE",0.24195,0.70748,0.00692,0.04365

"25","Overwhelmed suck cylinder. It's only become such a success because Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey. Women love stories like that because they can get into it. The 15-year-olds fall in love with Rájengoszling, the 25-year-olds have a tingling womb that they want such a guy, the lonely 35-year-olds push ice cream inside crying, the 40s living in a casual, passion-free relationship, and 50s imagine in their dreams that something is really with them something like this happened, and they didn't marry an electrician with a mustache, beer-bellied, named Józsi. 
I'm not saying it's a bad movie or a bad story, it wasn't that bad even with the characters. But his rating is far from so good because it would be such a big movie, but because women are incredibly easy to lead with a little romantic story, especially if you add sex scenes into it. It's a clear success, it can be any flat fostenger behind it, if there's sex, love, crying and screaming, it's already won. Oh, and of course, the huge social difference, which is also present in all these films, because the real story is only if one is rich, the other poor (or vampire) and at least half of the parents are definitely against it. Girl rebellion, that's what needs, especially for someone who has never done it in their own life. Yeah, and making out in the rain. Instant orgasm for women sitting in front of the TV, and they are already pushing 10 points.

"34","I don't understand why this film is so popular.
If you've seen or read a love story from your classic pen, I simply don't understand how you can be a buyer.
We do not learn any human character from the main characters except that the girl is rich and the boy is poor. Their relationship doesn't even know what it is that brings them together and then holds them together. All we know is that they fight all the time, but they love each other very much. In addition, the big “love” that has affected their lives and what they've been shaking back for years is actually just a little summer fling, where nothing happens between them bathing in the lake and looking at the stars. Of course, you have a young head, but that's what makes you a mature adult man. There is no development of character here either. The girl remains the same hysterics all the time, and the boy is a sheep-wearing slippers who can endure everything for love.
When a girl meets someone else in the beginning, we don't even know what kind of person she is, except that she's very rich. There is no real love triangle conflict.
Doesn't it turn out that the girl was eventually disowned from her wealth and chose poverty? Or do parents recognize their love? The only conflict arising from their social situation will eventually remain unresolved.
I sat at him with great hopes, but all I got was an inflated, improbable, empty lemonade.

I don't understand why those of you like this movie don't ask the question of why these two people fell in love at all? Most of all, the mystery to me is what the boy saw in the girl. The girl screaming during the whole film, annoyingly giggle or skin. I've summed up all the scenes with that. The attitudes of the side actors are still interesting. Okay, parents find it hard to accept their love, but there was a complication for the film to say something. But the girl's fiancé, who instead of freaking out about her fiancée cheating on her with some random worker guy, instead of saying love to her one more time and about supporting her. And the boy's new girlfriend makes friends with Allie, and then they say good-bye to each other as good girlfriends. How realistic is this???? Noah kind of kicks his ass out for her, but what do you get in return? Nothing, I think.

My evaluation (spoiler may be included): the film is good, even very good... it's such an easy, love story, but for some reasons it's “only” 9es for me:
I think the film is being run by the female lead, Rachel McAdams, and it gives a huge performance... I'm very comfortable with the fight that's in it.
Gosling's not bad, although his role may make him such a silly, speechless man, true what he's supposed to bring.
What I really didn't like afterwards (it was interesting to look at the movie), so when the lady's mother takes the girl to a place where she shows her love for decades...That's when I knew how the movie was going to end... and that's why it annoys me, because it makes her decide which guy to choose for a little while again.
In the end, unfortunately, there's a giga of exaggeration, the old people dying hand in hand... it shouldn't have been... too amerais, unfortunately.
But a nice movie, it's worth watching!","en",0.995689690113068,"POSITIVE",0.01614,0.00101,0.00694,0.97591

So: I loved Ryan Gosling later in his films, he was less handsome when he was young (and before plastics), but he played very well even at a young age! The acting games are excellent, Noah brings the role of a little introverted boy, whose watch says it all, and the chick in a lubicked role! 
I am a woman, and I want beautiful, eternal love, so of course I liked the film, because it made me believe that there is eternal love. It is a pity that there is no such thing as to see the two in one guy: that is, the rich, well-trained and educated guy is the one he is in love with. In mind, it may be dangerous to decide for someone from a completely different class who may not be intellectually able to tie him up for a lifetime.
Node back to the film: a little pretentious, even very much the end, the slumber together. I understand this with my mind, but my heart made tears... so little syrup, old times, lots of romance, lightness, love and rationality— decisions and responsibility, old age and togetherness. It had everything I needed to get the perfect score, but somehow I stood up at the end of the movie with tears in my eyes and my mind said, “What a silly movie it was<U+1366>)

It's not about being poor or rich or when Mama realized that her daughter should be allowed to make the right choice. This film will be beautiful by the behavior of the old couple and the old Noah. The fact that the film does not show all of their experiences together, the gray everyday days and the conflicts, one can guess that besides the many good memories they have gone through a lot of things, such as the senility and hysterics of the old lady, but nevertheless Noah stands by her and so it is round. When someone stands by someone, when they have no idea, because they loved each other at some point, it's a sore throat to me. And the fact that the diary was written by the lady precisely so that Noah would read it to her so she could remember - I think it's a very nice twist. The film may also require “internal work”, perhaps that's why it is considered cheesy and stencil by those who only see the pictures and cannot feel it. Or maybe they weren't really in love, but they weren't in love when they wrote their opinions, that's for sure.","en",0.997333705425262,"MIXED",0.51362,0.19294,0.02237,0.27107

I really like romantic films, the film started well, I like it when it takes place and the characters are very good too! But in the end, it got really bad, I don't like the old age in it. For the last 20 minutes, I was like it was over, they really screwed up the end, they should cut it out or I don't know. What a story about them dying together. It's nice to have eternal love and all, and for the woman this disease is pretty brutal. Besides, the movie's pretty towed, there's little emotion, true love doesn't come through as much as other love movies. I'm disappointed in the movie.

"251","There's so much to talk about and rant about this movie. What I'm surprised is that there's a division of opinions on a film like this. But perhaps this is not a miracle, because, as many others have said before me, it also comes from our differences in value and form. In any case, if I had to defend my opinion - that this film is a beautiful piece of its kind and a very special creation - then I would say let anyone think I'm too sensitive because I'm crying or naive because I'm capable of believing in that story. The miracles that exist are born when we begin to believe in them! A sentence is trite, but faith is a creative power. What do you have if you don't believe? If we never believed in stories like this, how could we ever experience those feelings that the film would like to tell us? 
We're different, okay. Still, I feel sorry for those to whom this film did not give anything extra. It gave me a lot... or perhaps a more accurate term, mediated. I could compare it to how reading books makes you more year by year, with each piece you become more, but you do not experience it as a sudden discovery. You can feel the movie all the way through, in some scenes your heart beats faster, you may be anxious or even cry. I think books can do the same. The only difference is that there are far fewer such rare good films than books. Summa summarum, excuse me for taking this long, my opinion is a little more concise:

I suggest, for example, in the category of “love” film, Love if you dare to watch 1-2 people. Now, that's not in an American robe:) Moreover, it makes me think, unlike this film, although it depends on who needs it: for the brainless rushing in the category “wow, but a beautiful movie was hum” or to think about a good movie.

The devotion that Noah was able to testify for the rest of his life is indescribable and only the one who loves someone with all his heart can do. 9,5/10
P.S.: for me the film carries in itself the feeling of death no matter how beautiful and fulfilled the past is, it is the past. It is a pity to dwell on the past, but sometimes it is important to stop and look at the present as an eternal and miraculous moment which, at a later stop, can be remembered happily and proudly with love in his heart.

"285","Unfortunately, I have to tell you the truth. I, who also likes romantic films well, and who also lists Jane Austen adaptations among his favorites, found it good first, less, and annoying the third. Maybe that's what love is like, maybe not, but this is the soap opera story where there is hardly a substantive conflict, i.e. beyond the fact that the girl has a hard time giving in, because in the beginning it is important to her social rank, let's face it - it didn't really work for me. 
It was like having a glimpse of Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling's personal life for over two hours. James Garner and Gena Rowlands are deeply respected, both of them are incredible great actors, and the highlights of the film are attached to them, and this film is made by Gena's son, so on the one hand it is no coincidence that he is included in it, and on the other hand it was a good choice, for me they were the ACTORTS in this film. Rachel McAdams is a lady still waiting to be proven to me (although I haven't seen Sherlock Holmes yet) and Ryan Gosling at Half Nelson if you want to know what kind of actor he is. No one will.
I would change the P.S. I love you in parallel that I don't know how pretentious that film is, but on the one hand, the book is better, and on the other hand, if it is not placed in the director's hand, it could have been better, and it should be acknowledged that Hilary Swank is simply not suitable for comedy, but romantic film especially not. His dramatic face is good for him (although I was not fainted at the Million Dollar Baby, even though I love Eastwood and Morgan Freeman), in all other genres it is very weak and his early films prove it. I think he figured that out too, because I haven't seen him in anything like this since, and he doesn't even have that kind of film in preparation.

"293","I ran into this movie yesterday, and then I watched it early in the night. 10/10.
His story was familiar before viewing it (even though I did not read the novel, only remembered the text), and since I knew Reader's Digest thanks to a selection of “A Walk to Remember”, I quickly looked to see if it was among them. Yes, it was published as “Book of Memories.”
Although, in principle, yesterday I wrote to “Walk into the past” that I would not have time to read it, I finished the book in two hours, because I was very curious about how faithful the adaptation was. In the case of the “Christmas Angel, the longest way/walk into the past”, I read the story twice before the film, and I must say that the director almost completely squeezed out the story, made changes in the character of the characters, and on the main, important points he changed the story.
However, after reading the book today, I have to say that the director of “The Notebook” paid due respect to the work, made almost minimal changes to the story (which do not change anything at all), but not the characters.
I can only congratulate him, he also depicted his passion with sufficient delicacy and without passing into syrups. Maybe in the novel, it was a little more subdued, but in the film, it's not gonna blow it.
In the case of “Walk to Remember” this can no longer be said about the director there —he received only a 5 rating because of the novel-, he passed on the other side of the horse, in a visual representation as well. Moreover, he made the mistake of moving too closely with trends, sacrificing what has to be said on the “altar” of making money.
I don't know Sparks's work, only those two novels, and I don't read romantic stories anyway, so I have no reference to how much it stands out from the horizon of “love” literature. On the other hand, I can tell from these two stories that on the one hand he believes deeply in God and is eternal, in one love. Perhaps this is why in these two novels he used the remembrance of old age, and even, to avoid the impatience of the present time, put back the tales of the past a few decades.
In any case, one of the, if not the best, love stories I could see and read (of course, the book does not surpass “A Walk to Remembert”).
Last but not least, I could fall in love with Rachel McAdams, too.","en",0.995685636997223,"POSITIVE",0.13672,0.07458,0.07704,0.71165

Best Love Story of the Year

I loved every minutes of this movie. I am not real big on love stories but Nights in Rodanthe is like ""The Notebook” of 2008. Richard Gere and Diane Lane have to perfect chemistry. This movie will have you in tears. Every moment of this film is telling the truth about love, forgiveness, and scarfice just saying love can come into our lives when we at least expect it
